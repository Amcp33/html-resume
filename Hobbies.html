    <h1>My hobbies</h1>
    <p>I don't have many hobbies, but I can definietly inform you on the ones I do.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>While I'm not a that involved, I do like playing some games here and there, that can provide me with a good story. Below will be an Image of a game I started playing recently.
        I do like recording myself, cause I like seeing my reactions afterwards.</p>

    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>I've loved drawing as long as I remember, I love being creative and just letting my hand be free on my paper. But recently it has come to my attention that maybe I'm not the best artist out there. As much as I have many ideas, the
        fact is that I am not skilled enough to understand the foundations of drawing. Either way, below, I will provide one of my most proudest drawing to date. He is my own original character
        that I made for a comic book series I probably will never publish.</p>

    <h2>Electronics and Tech</h2>
    <p>Another thing I really enjoy doing is dismantling devices and trying to fix them. Though usually I end up not being able to put them back together. I'm still learning though.
        One day, I will make my own superfighting robot! <img src="./Images/713t9qVz6uL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" height="22 px" alt="Small image of Megaman form the ruby spears series"/> Below is an image of a current project I'm working on (that I cannot understand what is wrong with.)</p>
